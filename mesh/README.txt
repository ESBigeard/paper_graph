Useful files in this folder are :

mesh_lem.txt : contains the mesh hierarchy
synonyms_lem.txt : contains all known synonyms of each prefered mesh label
exclude_list.txt : list of words that appear in the mesh but create too much noise and should be ignored

Other files in this folder are used to create or update those three.
